# Overview

My solutions written in Rust and Kotlin for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

## Disclaimer

Note that this code is **hacky, not polished or refactored in any way**, i.e. it is probably the worst spaghetti code you can imagine. Its sole purpose was to solve the puzzles, it should not be used
as example for good code. That means, after I retrieved the correct solution for a puzzle, **I left the source code as it is without any cleanup**. Or stated otherwise, **I intentionally gave myself
the permission to hack around...**
